# OpenVolumeMesh

![OpenVolumeMesh Logo](/documentation/images/OpenVolumeMesh_text_128.png)

A generic C++ data structure for arbitrary polyhedral meshes,
with specializations for tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes.

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction

The concepts of OVM are closely related to [OpenMesh](http://www.openmesh.org).
In particular, OpenVolumeMesh carries the general
idea of storing edges as so-called (directed) half-edges over to the face
definitions. So, faces are split up into so-called half-faces having opposing
orientations. Furthermore, in OpenVolumeMesh the data is arranged in a top-down
hierarchy, meaning that each entity of dimension n is defined through a
(ordered) tuple of entities of dimension (n-1). These are the intrinsic
adjacency relations of the volumentric meshes. One can additionally compute
bottom-up adjacencies which means that for each entity of dimension n, we also
store its local adjacencies to entities of dimension (n+1). These adjacency
relations have to be computed explicitly which can be performed in linear time
complexity. Both adjacency relations, the top-down and the bottom-up
adjacencies, are used to provide a set of iterators and circulators that are
comfortable in use. As in OpenMesh, OpenVolumeMesh provides an entirely generic
underlying property system that allows attaching properties of any kind to the
entities. In order to learn more about the implementational details of
OpenVolumeMesh, please refer to the online documentation available
at <http://openvolumemesh.org/Documentation/OpenVolumeMesh-Doc-Latest>.

OpenVolumeMesh is entirely written in C++, making heavy use of the
standard template library as well as template programming paradigms.
Although OpenVolumeMesh has been developed to the best of my knowledge,
it does not claim to be free from defects nor does it raises the claim to
have inveterate underlying implemented concepts. So, any ambitious developer
is invited to participate in the development process to make OpenVolumeMesh
a well-working, reliable, and useful library. Please feel free to commit
suggestions, bug reports, or patches to the OpenVolumeMesh project management
system (gitlab issue tracker), which you find at

<https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de:9000/OpenVolumeMesh/OpenVolumeMesh>,

or you can e-mail them directly to <martin.heistermann@unibe.ch> or <moebius@cs.rwth-aachen.de>.

The initial version of OpenVolumeMesh is described in detail in [
Kremer, M., Bommes, D., Kobbelt, L. (2013). *OpenVolumeMesh – A Versatile Index-Based Data Structure for 3D Polytopal Complexes*. IMR 2012](https://graphics.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/MKremer_OVM.pdf)


## Building and linking OpenVolumeMesh

You can build and install OpenVolumeMesh as static or shared library which can be linked
into C++ projects using any build system.

If your project uses CMake, you can integrate OpenVolumeMesh into
its build either using `add_subdirectory` to build OVM together with your project,
or using `find_package(OpenVolumeMesh)` to find a previously-installed standalone
library build.

Either option produces an `OpenVolumeMesh::OpenVolumeMesh` target.

### Build requirements

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) 3.12 or newer
* A C++17-compatible compiler (tested with GCC, Clang and MSVC)
* (Optional) [Doxyen](http://www.doxygen.org) for building the reference documentation
* (Optional, downloaded by CMake) [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest.git) for building the unit test suite.

### Command-line build

- Create a new build directory, e.g. "OVM-build-release", or whatever name might be suitable.

- Change into the recently created directory and type
  "cmake /path/to/OpenVolumeMesh/sources".

- If you want to change the build configuration, say from debug to release,
  type `ccmake .` or `cmake-gui .`.

- Once everything is configured to your satisfaction, type `cmake --build .` followed
  by `sudo cmake --build . -t install ` in order to build and install the library.

### MacOS/XCode build

- You can use cmake to generate XCode project files

### Windows / Visual Studio build

- You can either directly open the project using Visual Studio's CMake integration, or generate project files by using cmake directly.

#### Using Visual Studio's CMake integration
- TODO

#### Generating project files

On Windows, start the CMake gui tool and set the path to OpenVolumeMesh's
sources. Then select the target project type (Visual Studio 20xx)
and click on "Configure". Once everything is configured to your satisfaction,
click on "Generate". You will now find a Visual Studio project file
in the specified build folder (which is "Build" per default). Open this
file in Visual Studio and select "Build all".

## Concepts

### Supported mesh types
- Manifold volumetric meshes, limited support for non-manifold configurations
- self-adjacent entities

TODO: define exactly what configurations are allowed

### Entities

OpenVolumeMesh Entities are comprised of
- Vertices
- Edges and half-edges (directed edges), made of two vertices
- Faces and half-faces (directed faces), made up of a sequence of half-edges
- Cells, consisting of a set of half-faces

![Half-entities diagram](/documentation/images/halfedge_halfface.png)
![Entity Hierarchy diagram](/documentation/images/volume_mesh_hierarchy.png)

Entities are always stored in a top-down manner, i.e., entities of dimension $n$
are defined by their constituient entities of dimension $n-1$.

For every entity, there is a `Handle` type, which is a type-safe way of indexing meshes.

### Bottom-Up Incidence relations

For efficient mesh nagivation, OpenVolumMesh also provides bottom-up incidence
relations, i.e., iterators for higher-dimensional entities.
This support is optional: The different bottom-up incidences can be disabled
for lower memory usage and higher performance.

### Properties

OpenVolumeMesh supports storing data with any entity type using properties.
